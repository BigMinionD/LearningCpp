Variables defined within the body of a function are called local variables
- Function parameters are considered to be local variables as well

# Local Variable Lifetime
Function parameters are created and initialized when the function is entered
- Variables within the function body are created and initialized at the point of definition
- Local variables are destroyed in the opposite order
- An object's lifetime is the time between a variable's creation and its destruction (see Example 2.5.1)

# What Happens When an Object is Destroyed?
In most cases, nothing happens
- Any use of an object after its destruction will result in undefined behavior
- At some point after destruction, the memory used by the object will be deallocated (freed up for use)

# Local Scope (Block Scope)
An identifier's scope determines where the identifier can be seen and used within the source code
- An identifier is in scope when able to be used and out of scope when unable to be used
- Attempting to use an identifier that is out of scope will result in a compiler error

Identifier of a local variable has local scope, also called block scope
- A local variable is usable from the moment it is defined to the end of the current function (see Example 2.5.2)

# Functional Separation
Different functions can have variables with the same names (see Example 2.5.3)

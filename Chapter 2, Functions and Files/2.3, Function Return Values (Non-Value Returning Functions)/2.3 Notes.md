# Void Return Values
Functions are not required to return a value back to the caller
- The "void" returnType is used to tell the compiler that a function does not return a value (see Example 2.3.1)
- A function that does not return a value is called a Non-Value Returning Function

# Void Functions Do Not Need a Return Statement
A void function will automaticall return to the caller at the end of the function
- A return statement with no return value can be used at the end of the function, but it is redundant (see Example 2.3.2)

# Void Functions Cannot be Used in Expressions that Require Values
Some types of expressions require values (see Example 2.3.3)
- In the above example, the value needs to be provided on the right side of the "<<" operator
- If there is no value provided, there is a compiler error
- Cannot call a void function inside an expression (see Example 2.3.4)
- Trying to return a value in a non-value returning function will produce an error (see Example 2.3.5)

# Design Step 1: Define Your Goal
In order to write a successful program, I first need to define what my goal is
- I should be able to state this goal in one or two sentences
- It's often useful to express this as a user facing outcome

# Design Step 2: Define Requirements
Requirements is a fancy word for limits that the program needs to abide by
- Requirements should be focused on "what", not "how"

# Design Step 3: Define Your Tools, Targets, and Backup Plans
For experienced programmers, there are many things to consider, such as:
- Defining what target architecture and/or OS their program will run on
- Determining what set of tools they will be using
- Determining whether they will write their program alone or as part of a team
- Defining their testing/feedback/release strategy
- Determining how they will back up their code

For new programmers, this process is usually easy, except for storage and backups
- Usually best to store it on a different device such as a flash drive

# Design Step 4: Break Hard Problems Down Into Easy Problems
Task hierarchies are useful in programming
- Using the top-down method, or breaking one complex task into multiple simple sub-tasks, is easier

# Design Step 5: Figure Out the Sequence of Events
Now that the program has a structure, I need to figure out how to lay it all out
- I would need to figure out the sequence of events that would need to happen

# Implementation Step 1: Outlining Your Main Function
It's important to outline the program so it is easier to write (see Example 2.13.1)

# Implementation Step 2: Implement Each Function
Three things must be done for each function outlined (see Example 2.13.2)
- Define the function prototype (inputs and outputs)
- Write the function
- Test the function

# Implementation Step 3: Final Testing
Once the program has been written out, all that's left to do is test it to see if it works, and fix it if it doesn't

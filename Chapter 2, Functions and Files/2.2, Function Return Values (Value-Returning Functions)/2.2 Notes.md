Take a look at Example 2.2.1
- This program only needs one function, but it can be split into multiple (see Example 2.2.2)
- Notably, Example 2.2.2 doesn't work because the initialized variable doesn't get a value from "getValueFromInteger()"

# Return Values
When writing a user-defined function, I have to determine whether or not my function will return a value back to the caller (the function that calls another function)
- To return a value to the caller , I need to indicate what type of value will be returned by setting the function's return type
- I also need to use a return statement to send the value back to the caller, which is done by using the return statement and an expression together
- This process is called return by value (see Example 2.2.3)

# Fixing the Problem
Using return values, I can fix the problem presented in Example 2.2.2 (see Example 2.2.4)

# Revisiting main()
Now it's time for me to understand how main() actually works
- When the program is executed, the operating system calls the main() function
- Execution then jumps to the top of main(), and the statements in main() are executed sequentially
- Finally, the function returns a value, usually 0, and the program terminates
- main() has two special requirements in C++:
  - main() always has to be an int function
  - Explicit function calls to main() are not allowed (see Example 2.2.5)
- I should also define main() be at the bottom of the file and avoid calling it
- Global variables are initialized before main() is executed

# Status Codes
The return value from main() is called the status code, exit code, or return code
- This is used to determine whether the program was a success or not
- Status code of 0 means that the program executed normally

# A Value-Returning Function that does not Return a Value Causes Undefined Behavior
A function that returns a value is a value-returning function, with any function type other than void being a value-returning function
- A value-returning function must return a value to avoid undefined behavior (see Example 2.2.6)
- The only exception to this rule is main(), which will implicitly return 0 if there is no return statement
- Functions can only return a single value, but the function author can decide what that value means
- Functions can be called upon multiple times (see Example 2.2.7)

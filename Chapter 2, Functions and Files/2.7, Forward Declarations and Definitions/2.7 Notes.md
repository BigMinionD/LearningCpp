Attempting to call on functions before they're defined will lead to errors (see Example 2.7.1)
- The compiler compiles lines of code sequentially, and when it reaches line 5, it leads to errors because add() isn't defined until line 9
- I could just reorder the functions and it would be easy to do since this is a simple program
- However, in a larger and more complex program, it would be tedious to figure out which functions call upon which
- And in certain situations, such as when functions call each other, it's impossible to order them in a way that it will compile correctly
- In those cases, it's easier to use forward declarations

# Forward Declarations
Forward declarations allow me to let the compiler know about the existence of an identifier before it is defined (see Example 2.7.2)
- To use forward declarations, all I need to do is use a function declaration, also called a function prototype
- A function declaration is created by using the return type, name, parameters, and semicolon of a function without the function body
- Forward declarations can also be used for variables and types (this will be covered in future lessons)

# Forgetting the Function Body
There are two things that can happen if a forward delcaration is made but the function is not defined until later on
- One, if the function is not called upon, then nothing happens and the program compiles normally
- Two, if the function is called upon, then the compiler produces errors (see Example 2.7.3)

# Declarations vs Definitions
A declaration tells the compiler about the existence of an identifier while a definition actually implements the identifier (see Example 2.7.4)
- Declarations that aren't definitions are called pure declarations

# The One Definition Rule (ODR)
The One Definition Rule is one of the most well known rules in C++ and has three parts:
- Within a file, each function, variable, type, or template in a given scope can only have one definition, with definitions in different scopes not violating this rule
- Within a program, each function or variable in a given scope can only have one definition
- Types, templates, inline functions, and inline variables are allowed to have duplicate definitions in different files, as long as each definition is identical (More about most of these in future lessons)

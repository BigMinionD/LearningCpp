C++ requires all identifiers to be non-ambiguous
- If two identical identifiers are introduced in the same program in a way that the compiler or linker can't tell them apart, errors are produced
  - If the conflict is in the same file, the compiler produces the error
  - If the conflict is in different files, the linker produces the error
  - This error occurs even if the function is not called upon
- This error is referred to as a naming collision or naming conflict

# Naming Collision Example
Take a look at Example 2.9.1
- When the compiler compiles this program, it'll compile main.cpp and a.cpp independently and each file will compile with no problems
- The error occurs when the linker discovers the conflicting definitions for myFcn()

# Scope Regions
A scope region is an area of source code where all declared identifiers are considered distinct from names declared in other scopes
- Two identifiers with the same name can be declared in separate scope regions without causing a naming conflict
- Within a given scope region, all identifiers must be unique
- The body of a function is an example of a scope region

# Namespaces
A namespace provides another type of scope region called a namespace scope
- Allows me to declare or define names inside of it for the purpose of disambiguation
- The names declared in a namespace are isolated from names declared in other scopes, allowing those names to exist without conflict
- Namespaces can only contain declarations and definitions
- Creating my own namespace will be covered in a future lesson

# Global Namespace
In C++, any name that is not defined inside a class, function, or a namespace is considered to be part of an implicitly-defined namespace called the global namespace, sometimes called the global scope
- The global namespace will be discussed later, but for now there are two things I need to know
  - Identifiers declared inside the global scope are in scope from the point of declaration to the end of the file
  - Although variables can be defined in this, it's generally to be avoided (this will be discussed in a later lesson)
- Look at Example 2.9.2

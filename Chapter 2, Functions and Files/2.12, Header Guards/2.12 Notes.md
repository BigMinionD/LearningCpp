# Header Guards
Header guards are conditional compilation directives (see Example 2.12.1)
- Preprocessor will check if the function was already defined before
- All header files should have header guards (see Example 2.12.2)

# #pragma once
Modern compilers support an alternative called `#pragma once`
- Functions the same as a header guard
- Will not be supported on older compilers

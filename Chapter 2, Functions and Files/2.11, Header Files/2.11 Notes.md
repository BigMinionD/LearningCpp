# Header Files
`.cpp` files are not the only files seen in C++ programs
- There are also header files, which have a `.h`
  -  Sometimes they will have `.hpp`
- Header files are used as mass forward declarations
- `#include <iostream>` pulls `std::cout` and `std::cin` from the `iostream` header 
- Header files can include other headers

# Using Header Files to Propagate Forward Declarations
Go back to Example 2.8.1
- A header file can be added here (see Example 2.11.1)
- Header files consist of two things
  - Header guards (will be covered in a later lesson)
  - All forward declarations that will be used
- Adding a header file will be similar to adding a source code file

# Why Including Definitions in a Header File Violates the One Definition Rule
I can add function definitions to a Header File, but it is recommended not to (see Example 2.11.2)
- This violates the One Definition Rule as the linker sees that there is a definition of add() in add.h and in add.cpp

# Do NOT `#include` .cpp Files
There are many reasons as to why I should not do this
- Doing so can cause naming collisions between source files
- In a large project it can be hard to avoid the One Definition Rule
- Any change to the .cpp file will take a long time to recompile, while headers change less often than source files
- It is non-conventional to do so

The previous chapter defined functions as a collection of statements executed sequentially
- This is still true, but it didn't go into depth as to why they are useful
- In smaller programs such as the ones used in Chapter 1, only the main() funtion was needed
- However, in larger and more complex programs, having all of the code in the main() function will make it increasingly harder to manage
- Functions allow me to separate the code into smaller and more manageable chunks
- These other functions can be called upon with a function call that interrupts the current function to run the new one
- Once the next function is finished, it returns where the previous function left off
- These functions are called user-defined functions

# Examples of User-Defined Functions
For the next few lessons, the functions will take the form of the template used in Example 2.1.1.
- The first line is usually called the Function Header, and it tells the compiler about the existence of a function, the function's name, and other information that will be covered in future lessons (such as the type)
  - The lesson uses returnTypes int for the main() function and void otherwise (function types will be covered in the next lesson)
  - Functions have names similar to variables, with functionName being the identifier
  - The parentheses after functionName tell the compiler that I'm making a function
- The curly braces and statements between those curly braces are the function body
- To call a function, simply put in the function name and a set of parentheses (see Example 2.1.2)
- Functions can be called more than once (see Example 2.1.3)
- User-Defined Functions can call other User-Defined Functions (see Example 2.1.4)
- I cannot put functions inside other functions in C++

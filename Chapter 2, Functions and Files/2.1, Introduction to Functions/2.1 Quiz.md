# Question 1: In a function definition, what are the curly braces and statements in-between called?
The curly braces and statements in-between are called the function body.

# Question 2: What does the following program output? Do not compile it, just trace it mentally.
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

void doB()
{
    std::cout << "In doB()\n";
}

void doA()
{
    std::cout << "In doA()\n";

    doB();
}

// Definition of function main()
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Starting main()\n";

    doA();
    doB();

    std::cout << "Ending main()\n";

    return 0;
}

First, function "doB()" is defined. This tells the compiler to print the statement "In doB()" and a newline when executed.
Second, function "doA()" is defined. This tells the compiler to print the statement "In doA()" and a newline when executed, and then call the function "doB()".
Third, function "main()" is defined. This tells the compiler to print the statement "Starting main()" and a newline when executed, then call function "doA()", then call function "doB()" after "doA()" is finished, then print the statement "Ending main()" and a new line when executed.
This means that the following is outputted by the program:
"Starting main()"
"In doA()"
"In doB()"
"In doB()"
"Ending main()"

When a program is compiled, prior to compilation, each code file goes through a preprocessing phase
- In this phase, a program called the preprocessor makes various changes to the text of the code file
  - Does not actually modify the original files in any way
  - All changes made by the preprocessor are temporary in some way
- The preprocessor strips all comments and ensures each code file ends in a new line
- It is what processes the "#include" directives
- The result of the preprocessing is called a translation unit

# Preprocessor Directives
When the preprocessor runs, it scans through the code file from top to bottom, looking for preprocessor directives
- Preprocessor directives are instructions that start with the `#` symbol and end with a new line, not a semicolon
- Directives tell the preprocessor to perform certain text manipulation tasks
- Directives have their own syntax they follow

# #include
When I `#include` a file, the preprocessor replaces the `#include` with the contents of that file (see Example 2.10.1)
- Included contents are preprocessed along with the rest of the file

# Macro Defines
The `#define` directive can be used to create a macro
- In C++, a macro is a rule that defines how input text is converted into replacement output text
- Two types: object-like and function-like
  - Function-like macros act like functions and serve a similar purpose but are considered unsafe
  - Object-like macros can be defined either with or without substitution text (see Example 2.10.2)
- Macro names are all uppercase

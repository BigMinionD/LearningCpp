# Adding Files to Your Project
As programs get larger, it becomes common to create multiple source code files for organizational and reusability purposes
- To add a file, simply right click on the project folder to the side and select Add > New Item

# A Multi-File Example
Take a look at Example 2.8.1
- The compiler compiles each file individually
- This is for multiple reasons
  - It allows the source files to be arranged in any order
  - When a source file is changed, only that source file needs to be recompiled
  - It reduces the possibility of naming conflicts between identifiers in different files
- Forward declarations are needed to let the main file know of the existence of functions elsewhere

# Why Use Functions?
Functions provide a large number of benefits, especially for larger programs
- Organization: Having multiple functions allows me to divide a program into smaller, more manageable chunks
- Reusability: Once a function is written, it can be called multiple times within the program, preventing DRY
- Testing: Functions reduce redundancy and the amount of code that needs to be tested
- Extensibility: When I need to extend the program, I will only need to make a change in one place to affect the entire program
- Abstraction: I only need to know the name of the function, where it lives, and what it does, I won't have to learn how it works

# Effectively Using Functions
One of the biggest challenges new programmers encounter is understanding when and how to use functions effectively
- Groups of statements that appear in a program more than once should be turned into a function
- Code that has a well-defined set of inputs and outputs is a good candidate for functions
- A function should generally perform one task at most
- When a function becomes too long or complicated, it can be split into multiple sub-functions
  - This is called refactoring (more on that in 3.10)

A lot of programs in C++ will involve these three tasks:
- Reading inputs from the user
- Calculating a value from the inputs
- Printing the calculated value

For smaller programs that are 20 or so lines at most, some or all of these tasks can be done within the main() function
- However, for larger functions, each subtask can be its own function

Personal note: this is really short for some reason, not even examples

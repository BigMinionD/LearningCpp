# Chapter Introduction
The goal of this chapter will be to take a look at the topics essential to every C++ program
- Most will be covered at a very shallow level
- Meant to help me understand how basic C++ programs are constructed
- Most of these topics will be explored more in-depth in future chapters

# Statements
Statements are a type of instruction that cause the program to perform an action
- Most common type of instruction in a C++ program
- Smallest independent unit of computation in a C++ program
- Most end in a semicolon (;)
- In a high-level language, a single statement could translate into many machine language instructions

# Functions and the "main" Function
Statements are typically grouped into functions, which are a collection of statements that are executed sequentially (top to bottom)
- Statements inside main executed in sequential order
- Programs typically terminate after the last line in "main" has been executed
- Functions are created to do a specific job
- The name of the function is called the identifier

# Characters and Text
Earliest computers designed primarily for mathematical calculations and data processing
- As hardware improved, networking became accessible, and consumer software evolved, computers also became valuable tools for written communication
- In written form, a character is the most basic form of communication
- A character is a written symbol or mark, such as a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or mathematical symbol
- Typing a letter or number on the keyboard produces a character and displays it on the screen
- A sequence of characters is called a text or a string

# Dissecting Hello World
(See Example 1.1.1)
Line one is a special line called a preprocessor directive
- #include preprocessor indicates that I want to use the iostream library, which is the part of the C++ library that allows me to read and write text from/to the console
- This line is needed in order to use std::out, or the compiler will not recognize it

Line two is blank and is ignored by the compiler
- Meant to make the program more readable for humans

Line three tells the compiler to define the function "main"
- Every C++ program must have a main function or it will break
- This function will provide a value whose type is "int" (integer)

Lines 4 and 7 tell the program which lines of code are part of the main function
- Everything between the opening curly brace on line 4 and the closing curly brace on line 7 is part of "main"
- This is called the function body

Line 5 is the first statement within the main function
- "std::cout" (character outptu) and the << operator allows me to display information on the console, "Hello World!" in this case
- This statement creates the visible output on the program

Line 6 is the return statement
- When an executable finishes running, the program sends a value back to the operating system in order to indicate whether it was executed successfully or not
- In this case, the statements returns 0, which means everything went okay
- This is the last statement the program executes

All functions follow this template or a variation of it

# Syntax and Syntax Errors
The English language has specific rules that its sentences must follow
- Syntax is the set of rules that describe how words can be arranged to form sentences
- C++ also has syntax, although it is much stricter than the English language
- These syntax errors are straightforward and easy to fix
- Most statements must end in a semicolon, or the program won't run (see Example 1.1.2)

# Chapter Introduction
The goal of this chapter will be to take a look at the topics essential to every C++ program
- Most will be covered at a very shallow level
- Meant to help me understand how basic C++ programs are constructed
- Most of these topics will be explored more in-depth in future chapters

# Statements
Statements are a type of instruction that cause the program to perform an action
- Most common type of instruction in a C++ program
- Smallest independent unit of computation in a C++ program
- Most end in a semicolon (;)
- In a high-level language, a single statement could translate into many machine language instructions

# Functions and the "main" Function
Statements are typically grouped into functions, which are a collection of statements that are executed sequentially (top to bottom)
- Statements inside main executed in sequential order
- Programs typically terminate after the last line in "main" has been executed
- Functions are created to do a specific job
- The name of the function is called the identifier

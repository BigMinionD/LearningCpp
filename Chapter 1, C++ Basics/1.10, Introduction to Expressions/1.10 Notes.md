An expression is a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a value (see Example 1.10.1)
- The process of executing an expression is called evaluation
- The resulting value produced is called the result or return value
- When an expression is evaluated, each of the terms in the expression are evaluated until a single value remains
- Expressions do not end in a semicolon and cannot be compiled by themselves

# Expression Statements
Certain expressions are used for their side effects instead of the value they produce
- A semicolon can be put at the end of these expressions to turn them into expression statements
- When an expression statement is executed, the return value of the expression is discarded
- These can work for any expression, although they will become useless and some compilers will complain

# Subexpressions, Full Expressions, and Compound Expressions
A subexpression is an expression that is used as an operand
- A full expression is an expression that is not a subexpression
- A compound expression is an expression that contains two or more uses for operators

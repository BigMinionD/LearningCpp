# The Input/Output Library
The input/output library, or io library, is the part of the C++ Standard Library that deals with basic input and output
- Mainly used to get input from the keyboard and output data to the console
- The "io" part of the "iostream" stands for "input/output"
- "#include <iostream>" is used to include the iostream library

# std::cout
The iostream library contains a few predefined variables for me to use
- One of the most useful is "std::cout", which allows me to send data to the console to be printed as text
- "cout" stands for "character output"
- Used for the "Hello World" program used at the start of the course
- Can also print numbers and variables (see Examples 1.5.1 and 1.5.2)
- The insertion operator "<<" can be used multiple times to put multiple things on the same line (see Example 1.5.3)
- This can include strings, numbers, and variables (see Example 1.5.4)

# Using "std:endl" to Output a New Line
Attempting to just use "std::cout" on multiple lines will result in everything being on the same line (see Example 1.5.5)
- In order to have multiple outputs on different lines, the compiler must be told to move the cursor down a line
- This can by outputting a new line using "std::endl" (see Example 1.5.6)
- The second "std::endl" in the above example is not necessary, but it is useful for a few reasons
- First, it helps indicate a complete thought so that it is closer to standard English
- Second, if I want to add more lines of output, it is already there so I don't have to add it later
- Third, after running an executable from the command line, some operating systems don't output a new line before showing the command prompt again, so adding "endl" helps ensure that the command prompt isn't appended to the end of the output

# "std::cout" is Buffered
Statements in my program request that output be sent to the console, but it is not sent to the console immediately
- Instead, it is stored in a region of memory set aside to collect these requests, called a buffer
- Periodically, the buffer is flushed, which means all of the data collected is sent to its destination, the console

# "std::endl" vs "\n"
Using "std::endl" is often inefficient, as it does two jobs:
- It outputs a new line and flushes the buffer, which is slow
- If I output multiple lines ending with "std::endl", the buffer will be flushed every time a new line is started
- This is slow and often unnecessary
- When outputting to the console, I don't need to constantly flush the buffer myself
- C++ is designed to self-flush the buffer periodically, with it being more efficient to let it do so

To output a new line without manually flushing the buffer, I can simply use "\n", which is often in single or double quotes
- This is a special symbol that the compiler interprets as a newline character
- "\n" allows the program to move the cursor down without flushing the buffer, so it'll perform more efficiently
- "\n" is also easier to type and can be embedded into existing double-quoted text (see Example 1.5.7)
- "\n" will be covered in more detail in Lesson 4.11
- Do NOT use a forward slash (/) for "\n", as that will cause the program to break

# "std::cin"
"std::cin" is another predefined variable in the iostream library
- Reads input from the keyboard
- Typically uses the extraction operator ">>" (see Example 1.5.8)
- An easy way to get input from the user
- It is possible to put in more than one value on a single line (see Example 1.5.9)
- Values entered should be separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, or new lines)

# "std::cin" is Also Buffered
Just like cout, cin is also a two stage process
- The individual characters entered as input are added to the end of an input buffer
- Enter key is also stored as a new line
- ">>" operator removes characters from the front of the input buffer and assigns them to a variable
- That variable can then be used in following statements

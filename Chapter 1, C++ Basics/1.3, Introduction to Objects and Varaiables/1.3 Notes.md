A program can access data (information that is moved, processed, or stored by a computer) to work in many ways
- From a file or database
- Over the network
- From a user providing input on a keyboard
- From the programmer putting information directly into the source code
- Program then sends information to the monitor to be displayed

A single piece of data is called a (data) value
- Numbers that are not quoted
- Characters that are put between single quotes, with only one character able to be used
- Strings of text that are put between double quotes, with zero or more characters able to be used
- Values put directly into the source code are literals (see Lesson 5.2 for Literals)
- One of the most common thing to do with values is to print them on the screen (see example 1.3.1)
- If a value is not properly quoted, the compiler will try to run it as C++ code and lead to compiler errors

Literals are the easiest way to read values
- Read-only values, meaning they can't be modified

# Random Access Memory (RAM)
The main memory in a computer is called Random Access Memory, or RAM for short
- Operating System runs a running program into RAM
- Any data hardcoded into the source code is loaded at this point
- Operating System also reserves extra RAM for the program to use while it is running
- Extra RAM is often used for inputs from the user, to store data read from a file or network, or to store values calculated while the program is running so they can be used again later
- Compared to a series of numbered boxes used to store data while the program is running
- It is possible to directly access these boxes in older languages such as Applesoft BASIC

# Objects and Variables
Direct memory access is discouraged in C++
- Memory is instead indirectly accessed through regions of storage called objects
- Objects also have other uses (to be covered in later lessons)
- Objects in C++ can be unnamed
- Objects with names are called variables

# Variable Definition
In order to use a variable, the compiler must be told that there is one
- Most common way to do this is by using a special kind of declaration called a definition (the difference between declarations and definitions will be covered in Lesson 2.7)
- See Example 1.3.2 for an example of defining a variable
- When it is time to compile the program, the compiler will note this variable and that the variable has the data type "int"
- The compiler will know that I am referring to this variable whenever it is called later in the program
- The compiler will handle the rest of the details about the variable for me
- A variable created via a definition statement is said to be defined at the point where the definition statement is placed
- Definition statement should be placed in main() for now

# Variable Creation
At runtime, each object is given a storage location that it can use to store values
- The process of reserving storage for an object's use is called allocation
- The object will be created and can be used when allocation is complete

# Data Types
A data type determines what value the object will store
- The type of object must be known at compile-time
- The type cannot be changed without recompiling the program
- C++ allows for custom types to be created (more on that in a future lesson)

# Defining Multiple Variables
It is possible to define multiple variables of the same type in a single statement by separating names with a comma (see Examples 1.3.3 and 1.3.4)
- There are three common mistakes that can be done when defining variables this way
- First is to give each variable its own type (see Example 1.3.5)
- Second is to try to define variables of different types on the same line (see Example 1.3.6)
- Third mistake will be covered in the next lesson

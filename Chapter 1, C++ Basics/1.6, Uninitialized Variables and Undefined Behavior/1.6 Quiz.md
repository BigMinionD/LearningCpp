# Question 1: What are uninitialized variables, and why should you avoid them?
Uninitialized varables are variables that have not been given a value through either assignment or initialization, and should be avoided as they can lead to undefined behavior.

# Question 2: What is undefined behavior, and what can happen if you do something that exhibits undefined behavior?
Undefined behavior is the result of executing code that has behavior not well-defined by C++. Undefined behavior can have a variety of effects, up to and including working inconsistently and crashing periodically.

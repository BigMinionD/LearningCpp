Unlike most programming languages, C and C++ do not automatically initialize variables to a given value
- When a variable that is not initialized is given a memory address to use to store data, the default value will be whatever value is already there
- A variable that has not been given a value through initialization or assignment is known as an uninitialized variable
- Using uninitialized variables can lead to unexpected results (see Example 1.6.1)
- Most modern compilers will detect uninitialized variables as errors
- Attempting to run the above program will result in errors, but there is a way to get around this (see Example 1.6.2)

# Undefined Behavior
Using a value from an uninitialized variable is an example of undefined behavior
- Undefined behavior is the result of executing code whose behavior is not well-defined by C++
- C++ doesn't have any rules for what happens if I use a variable without a value
- As a result, undefined behavior occurs

Undefined behavior has many different symptoms, with my program possibly:
- producing different results every time it is executed
- producing consistent incorrect results every time it is executed
- behaving inconsistently
- seeming like it works until I get later into the program
- crashing either immediately or later
- working on some compilers and not working on others
- working until I change some seemingly unrelated code
- producing the correct results anyway

# Implementation-Defined-Behavior and Unspecified Behavior
A specific compiler and its associated standard library it comes with is called an implementation
- C++ has some cases where it allows the implementation to determine how some aspects of the language will behave
- Behavior defined by the implementation is called implementation defined behavior (see Example 1.6.3 for an example, sizeof will be covered later)

Unspecified behavior is similar to implementation defined behavior in that the behavior is up to the implementation to define
- The implementation does not need to document the behavior
- I should avoid implementation defined behavior and unspecified behavior as much as I can

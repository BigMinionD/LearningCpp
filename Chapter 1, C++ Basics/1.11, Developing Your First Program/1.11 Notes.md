# Multiply by 2
The program being created will ask the user to put in an integer, wait for them to put in the integer, and then tell them what 2 times that number is
- Create a console project
- Create main() function and insert return 0
- Insert "#include <iostream>" at the top of the program
- Insert a std::cout statement asking the user to enter an integer
- Initialize a variable (called "num" in this example) and then use std::cin to get the integer
- Use an expression to multiply the variable by 2 and then print the result
- See Example 1.11.1 to see this program

Whitespace is a term that refers to characters that are used for formatting purposes
- In C++, this usually refers to spaces, tabs, and newlines
- Used for separating certain language elements, inside text, and for formatting code

# Some Language Elements Must be Whitespace-Separated
The syntax of the language requires that some elements are separated by whitespace
- Mostly occurs when two keywords or identifiers must be placed consecutively
- Inside quoted text, whitespace is taken literally
- Whitespace is generally ignored otherwise, making it useful to making code more readable to humans

# Recommendations for Basic Formatting
These are the recommended practices to use for formatting code
- It is fine to use either tab or spaces for indentation
- I can put the opening curly brace either on the same line as its function or on the line right after it
- Each statement within curly braces should start one tab in from the opening brace of the function it belongs to
- Lines should not be too long, with around 80 characters typically being the recommended maximum
- If a long line is separated with an operator, the operator should be placed at the beginning of the next line, not the end of the current line
- I should use whitespace to make my code easier for humans to read
- If I am working in someone else's coding base, I should adapt to their style and try to follow it
- See Example 1.8.1 for good and bad examples of formatting

# Automatic Formatting
Most modern IDEs will help me format my code as I type it

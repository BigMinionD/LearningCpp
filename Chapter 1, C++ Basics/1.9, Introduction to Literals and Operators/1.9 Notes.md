A literal, also known as a literal constant, is a fixed value that has been inserted into the code
- Literals and variables both have values and types
- The value of a literal is fixed and cannot be changed (see Example 1.9.1)

# Operators
An operation is a process involving zero or more input values called operands that produce new values called output values (see Example 1.9.2)
- The specific operation to be performed is denoted by a symbol called an operator
- The number of operands that an operator takes as input is called the operator's arity, of which there are four types
  - Unary operators act on one operand, with the "-" operand being an example
  - Binary operators act on two operands, left and right of the symbol, with the "+" operand being an example
  - Ternary operators act on three operands, although the one example will be covered later
  - Nullary operators act on zero operands, although the one example will be covered later
- Some operators have different contexts, with the "-" being able to both invert a number's sign and be used for subtraction
- Operators used for mathematics will follow PEMDAS

# Chaining Operators
Operators can be chained together so that the output of one operator can be used as the input for another operator

# Return Values and Side Effects
Most operators just use their operands to calculate a return value
- There are some that do not calculate return values, but those will be covered later
- Some operators have additional functions, known as side effects

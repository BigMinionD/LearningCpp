# Question 1: For each of the following, indicate what they output.
## a: std::cout << 3 + 4 << '\n';
The above is an addition expression using the literals "3" and "4". "3" + "4" is "7", so the statement will output "7".

## b: std::cout << 3 + 4 - 5 << '\n';
The above takes the previous expression and subtracts the literal "5" from it. Following PEMDAS, "3" + "4" is "7", and "7" - "5" is "2", so the statement will output "2".

## c: std::cout << 2 + 3 * 4 << '\n';
The above involves both multiplication in the form of literals "3" and "4" and addition in the form of literal "2" and the product of "3" and "4". Following PEMDAS, "3" * "4" is "12", and "2" + "12" is "14", so the statement will output "14".

## d (extra credit):
### int x { 2 };
### std::cout << (x = 5) << '\n';
In the first statement, the variable "x" is initialized with the value "2". However, in the second statement, it says that "x = 5". Since "x" is a variable and not a literal, "x" has its value changed to "5". Therefore, the second statement will print the value "5".

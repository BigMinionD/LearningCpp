# Question 1: Based on how you *should* name a variable, indicate whether each variable name is conventional (follows best practices), unconventional (will compile but does not follow best practices), or invalid (will not compile), and why.
## int sum {} (assume it's obvious what we're summing)
This identifier is conventional because it is a single lowercase word.

## int _apples {};
This identifier is unconventional because it has an underscore at the front.

## int VALUE {};
This identifier is unconventional because it is a completely uppercase word.

## int my variable name {};
This identifier is invalid because it contains whitespace.

## int TotalCustomers {};
This identifier is unconventional because both words have an uppercase first letter.

## int void {};
This identifier is invalid because it is a keyword reserved by the C++ standard library.

## int numFruit {};
This identifier is conventional because the first word is entirely lowercase and the second word has its first letter in uppercase.

## int 3some {};
This identifier is invalid because an identifier can only start with a letter or an underscore, not a number.

## int meters_of_pipe {};
This identifier is conventional because its words are separated by underscores.

C++ reserves a set of 92 words (as of C++23) for its own use called keywords
- Each keyword has a specific meaning in C++ (see Example 1.7.1 for a list of all keywords)
- C++ also defines special identifiers, known as override, final, import, and module
- These identifiers have specific meanings when used in specific contexts, but not used otherwise

# Identifier Naming Rules
C++ gives a lot of freedom when naming variables, but there are still a few rules to follow
- An identifier cannot be a keyword, as they are reserved
- An identifier can only be composes of letters, numbers, and the underscore character, with no symbols or whitespace allowed
- An identifier can only start with a letter or the underscore character, not a number
- C++ is case sensitive, and thus distinguishes between lower and uppercase letters

# Identifier Naming Practices
There are multiple practices that it is best to follow when naming variables
- Identifiers conventionally start with a lowercase letter, as functions do
- There are two conventions for identifiers with multiple words
- The first is separating each word with an underscore
- The second is having them intercapped, with the first word being lowercase and the rest of the words having their first letter as uppercase (this is sometimes called camelCase)
- Avoid starting a variable name with an underscore as those are typically reserved for OS, library, and/or compiler use
- Identifier names should be easy to understand and make the value they're holding clear
- Avoid abbreviations except when they are common and unambiguous
- Sometimes it is easier to use a comment to explain what a variable is used for
- If I am working in someone else's code, it is better to follow their coding style instead of trying to follow the conventions above

Sometimes there are benefits to having a longer or shorter identifier
- If an identifier only exists for a few statements, it should probably have a shorter name
- If an identifier is accessible everywhere, it should probably have a longer name
- If an identifier represents a non-specific number, it should probably have a shorter name
- If an identifier represents a specific value, it should probably have a longer name

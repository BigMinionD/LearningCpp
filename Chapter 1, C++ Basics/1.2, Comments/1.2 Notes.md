A comment is a programmer-readable note that is inserted directly into the source code of the program
- Comments are ignored by the compiler
- Meant to help explain the source code
- There are two kinds of comments

# Single Line Comments
The "//" Symbol begins a C++ single line comment, which tells the compiler to ignore anything after that symbol on a line. (See Example 1.2.1)

The single line comment is usually used to make a comment about a single line of code (see Example 1.2.2)
- Having comments to the right of a line make it difficult to read both the code and the comment
- If the line is fairly short, it can be aligned with a tab stop (see Example 1.2.3)
- If the line is fairly long, the comment should be placed above the line (see Example 1.2.4)

# Multi-Line Comments
The "/* " and "*/" symbols denote a multi-line comment. Everything in between the symbols is ignored (see Example 1.2.5)
- Sometimes programmers will "beautify" their comments (see Example 1.2.6)
- Multi-line comments cannot be nested, as otherwise there will be errors (see Example 1.2.7)
- The compiler ignores everything from the first /* to the first */

# Proper Use of Comments
Mainly used to explain what the program or a specific function will do, how it will do so, and why it is doing so
- Give the reader of the code an idea of what the code is trying to do without having to look at the code

# Commenting out Code
Converting one or more lines of code into a comment is called commenting out code
- Provides a convenient way to temporarily exclude specific lines of code from being executed

There are a few reasons to do this:
- I'm working on a piece of code that won't compile yet, and I need to run the program
- I've written new code and it compiles, but it doesn't work correctly and I don't have time to fix it
- I need to find the source of an error but I don't want to delete certain code
- I need to replace one piece of code with another, but I don't want to delete the old code just yet

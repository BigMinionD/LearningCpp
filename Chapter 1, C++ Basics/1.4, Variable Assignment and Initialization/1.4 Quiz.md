# Question 1: What is the difference between initialization and assignment?
Assignment uses a separate statement to give a value to a variable, while initialization gives a value to a variable in the same statement.

# Question 2: What form of initialization should you prefer when you want to initialize a variable with a specific value?
Direct list initialization is the most preferred if I want to initialize a variable with a specific value, mainly because it provides a syntax that works for almost all cases.

# What are default-initialization and value-initialization? What is the behavior of each? Which should you prefer?
Default initialization defines a variable and does not give it a value. Value initialization gives the variable an empty value, which usually defaults to 0. Value initialization is usually preferred because it gives a value to the variable, while default initialization does not.

Programs are executed on a computer's hardware, or the physical components that make up a computer. Notable hardware includes:
- A CPU (central processing unit) that actually executes the instructions, often called the "brain" of the computer
- Memory where computer programs are loaded prior to execution
- Interactive devices that allow a person to interact with the computer, such as a monitor, touch screen, keyboard, or mouse
- Storage devices that retain information even when the computer is off, such as a hard drive, solid state disk, or flash memory

Software is a broad term that refers to the programs executed by the hardware.
- Sometimes runs other software

A platform is a compatible set of hardware and software that provides an environment for software to run.
- Often provides useful services for the programs running on them

# Types of Programming Languages
## Machine Language
A computer's CPU cannot understand languages such as C++
- Instead, they can only process instructions written in machine language, or machine code
- The set of all possible machine language instructions a given CPU can understand is called the Instruction Set
- An example of this is Binary, which is a combination of 0s and 1s
- These 0s and 1s are called a binary digit, bit for short
- CPUs can understand varying lengths of bit instructions
- Each CPU family has its own language, which other CPUs cannot understand

## Assembly Languages
Machine languages are ideal for a machine, but difficult for a human to understand

An assembly language is a programming language that is more accessible for humans
- Assembly language is translated into a machine language by an assembler
- Each CPU has its own assembly language similar to machine languages

## Low-Level Languages
Machine and assembly languages are both considered low level languages because of how little abstraction is provided

There are a number of downsides to these languages:
- Programs written in these languages are not portable
- Writing a program in a low-level language requires detailed knowledge in the architecture itself
- Low-level languages can be hard to understand
- It is hard to write more complex programs with these languages because it can only provide for more simplistic capabilities

The primary benefit is that these languages are fast
- Assembly is still used when performance is critical

# High-Level Languages
Developed to address many of the downsides of low-level languages
- Early examples include C, C++, and Pascal
- Languages such as Java, Javascript, and Pearl were developed later on

Programs written in a high-level language must be translated before they can be executed
- Done in two ways: compiling and interpreting
- C++ programs are usually compiled

A compiler reads the source code of a high-level language and translates it into a low-level language
- Machine code output can then be packaged into an executable file that can be distributed to others and launched by the operating system
- Running the .exe file doesn't require the compiler to be installed
- Compilers used to be primitive and produce slow and unoptimized programs
- They have evolved over the years to produce faster and optimized programs

An interpreter directly executes the source code without compiling it
- They can be more flexible, but less efficient
- Interpretation needs to be done every time the program is executed

#Benefits of High-Level Languages
- Allows for a higher level of abstraction from the underlying architecture
- Allows programmers to run programs without having to know the platform it is running on
- Makes programs both easier to write and more portable
- Easier to read, write, and learn because they resemble natural language more
- Includes additional capabilities that make it easier to perform certain capabilities

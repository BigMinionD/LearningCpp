# Step 4: Compiling the source code
A C++ compiler is used to compile C++ files
- Goes through each ".cpp" file sequentially
- Checks C++ code to ensure it follows the rules of the C++ language and aborts the process if it does not
- Translates the C++ language into machine language and stores the instructions in a file caled an "object file"
- Object file also contains other data required or useful in subsequent steps
- Object files are usually named "name.o" or "name.obj", where "name" is the name of the ".cpp" file it originated from

# Step 5: Linking object files and libraries and creating the desired output
After the compiler is finished, another program called the "linker" is activated
- Combines all of the object files and produces the desired output file in a process called "linking"
- If any step in the linking process fails, then the process is aborted and an error message is produced

The linking process:
- First, the linker reads each object file and makes sure they are valid
- Second, the linker ensures all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly
- Third, the linker typically links in one or more "library files", which are packages of precompiled code for use in other programs
- Finally, the linker outputs the desired file, usually as an executable (.exe) that can be launched, but can also be a library file

## The Standard Library
C++ comes with an extensive library called "the C++ Standard Library" or "the Standard Library" to provide a set of useful capabilities for use in programs
- One of the most commonly used parts of the library is the Input/Output library, often called the "iostream", which contains functionality for printing text on a monitor and getting keyboard input from a user
- Almost every C++ program uses the Standard Library in some way, thus it is common to have it linked into the programs in someway
- Most C++ linkers are configured to link in the standard library by default, so it is not something to worry about

## Third Party Libraries
Third party libraries, or libraries that are created and distributed by independent entities, can be optionally linked into the C++ program

Linking and creating third party libraries will be covered in the appendix

## Building
The term "building" is often used to refer to the full process of converting the source code files into an executable
- A specific executable is often referred to as a build

# Steps 6 & 7: Testing and Debugging
Referred to as the fun part of the process
- Usually refers to running an executable and seeing what it does
- Testing is the process of assessing the software to see if it works as expected
- Involves trying different input combinations to ensure the software behaves correctly
- If the program does not work as expected, then the debugging process starts
- Debugging is referred to as the process of finding and fixing errors in the code
- Testing and debuggin will be covered more in-depth in future chapters

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Steps 3, 4, 5, and 7 all involve software programs that must be installed separately (editor, compiler, linker, debugger)
- Separate programs can be used for each process, but it is a hassle to do so
- It is more common to use a software package called an "Integrated Development Environment" (IDE) that bundles and integrates all of these features together
- IDEs, and how to install one, will be covered in the next lesson

A typical modern IDE will include:
- Some way to easily save and load files
- A code editor that has programming-friendly features, such as line numbering, syntax highlighting, integrated help, name completion, and automatic source code formatting
- A basic build system for compiling and linking programs into an executable and running it
- An integrated debugger to make it easier to find and fix software defects
- Some way to install plugins to modify the IDE or add capabilities such as version control

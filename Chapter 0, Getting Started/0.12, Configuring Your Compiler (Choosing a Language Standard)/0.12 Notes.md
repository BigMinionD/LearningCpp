Compilers usually select a standard to default to
- Typically not the most recent language standard, instead using C++14
- Will have to manually configure the compiler to use the latest standard

# What Language Standard Should I Choose?
In professional standards, it is common for the language standard to be one or two versions behind the latest one
- This is to ensure that the compiler makers have had a chance to resolve defects
- Helps ensure the best practices for new features are understood
- ALso helps ensure better cross-platform compatibility where relevant

For personal projects, the latest standard is recommended

Seeing what language standard the compiler is currently using will be covered in the next lesson

Compiler will check to make sure the program is following the rules
- If the code violates the rules, it is ill-informed
- Compiler will emit a diagnostic message, diagnostic for short, whenever it encounters an error
- Usually produced when the compiler encounters an error it deems serious enough to stop compiling
- Also called diagnostic/compiler errors
- There are also compiler warnings, where the compiler has found an issue but doesn't deem it serious enough to stop compilation
- Diagnostic messages typically contain both the file name and the line number and some text about what was expected vs what was found
- Usually best to solve warnings and treat them as if they were errors

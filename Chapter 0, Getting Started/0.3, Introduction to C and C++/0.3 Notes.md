# C
C was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories
- Designed to give a lot of control to the programmer while allowing them to write a program that could be executed on different platforms
- Ended up being so flexible that it was used to rewrite the Unix OS in 1973

Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published a book called "The C Programming Language" in 1978
- Nicknamed the "K&R" after the authors' last initials
- Offered an informal specification for the language and became the standard

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to establish a formal standard for C in 1983
- Finished and released the C89 standard in 1989
- The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted ANSI C in 1990, which became known as C90
- ISO Committee released C99 in 1999

# C++
Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C in 1979
- Added many new features to the C language
- Seen as a subset of C
- C99 introduced features C++ does not have
- Most notable innovation over C is support for object-oriented programming (will be covered in later chapters)
- Standardized by the ISO Committee in 1998
- Minor update to the language published in 2003 (referred to as C++03)
- Five updates have been made since them (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23)

# Questions about C++
## What is C++ good at?
Mainly for situations where high performance is necessary, such as:
- Video games
- Real-time systems for transportation, manufacturing, etc.
- High-performance financial applications
- Graphical applications and simulations
- Productivity/office applications
- Embedded software
- Audio and video processing
- Artificial intelligence and neural networking

C++ also has a large amount of high-quality third party libraries available that shorten development times significantly

## Isn't C++ dying?
Short answer is no
- C++ is the second/third most popular compiled language, behind java and sometimes C#, and ahead of C
- It is the fifth or sixth most popular language overall, excluding HTML, SQL, and shell scripting languages

## Do I need to know C to learn C++?
No, it is perfectly fine to learn C++ without having learned C first
- C is only really used for niche cases anyways, with C++ being more commonly used

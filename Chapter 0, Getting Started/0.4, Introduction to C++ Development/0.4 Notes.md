Before writting and executing the first C++ program, it is important to learn how a program is developed

# Step 1: Define the problem to solve
This is the "what" step of the process
- Conceptually, it is the simplest step of the process
- Defining the problem can be either easy or difficult

# Step 2: Define how the problem will be solved
The "how" step of the process
- Also the most neglected step of the process
- Many ways to solve a problem
- Some are good, but most are bad
- Coders will get an idea and immediately start coding the solution - this is a bad solution

Good solutions have the following qualities:
- They are straightforward, not overly complicated or confusing
- They are well documented, especially around any assumptions and limitations
- They are built moderately, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program
- They can recover gracefully or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens

# Step 3: Writting the actual program
Two things are needed to write a program:
- Knowledge of a programming language, what these tutorials are for
- A code editor to write and save programs in

A code editor has the following qualities:
- Numbered lines for finding errors quicker
- Syntax highlighting and coloring to highlight different components of the program
- An unambiguous, fixed-width font often called a "monospace font" that makes sure similar symbols are differenciated well enough

Simple C++ programs usually only have one file, but more complex C++ programs usually have many files, up to the hundreds or thousands
- Each file needs to be saved to the disk, which means each file needs a different name
- There is no requirements for naming files, but it is standard to name the first/primary file "main.cpp"
- The filename of "main" helps differentiate it from the other files as the primary file
- The ".cpp" helps identify it as a C++ file
- Sometimes the primary file will be named after the name of the program instead, such as "calculator.cpp" or "poker.cpp"
- Other extensions, such as ".cc" or ".cxx", may be used as well

Steps 4-7 will be covered in the next lesson

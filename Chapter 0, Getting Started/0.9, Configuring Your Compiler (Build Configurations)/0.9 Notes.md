A build configuration, also called a build target, is a collection of project settings that determines how the IDE will build my project. It typically includes things such as:
- What the executable will be named
- What directories the IDE will look in for other code and libraries
- Whether to keep or strip out debugging information
- How much the compiler should optimize the program
- These settings should generally be kept at their default unless I have a specific reason to change them

When I create a new project in an IDE, most of them will set up two different build configurations: a release configuration and a debug configuration

A debug configuration is meant to help me debug my program and is generally the one I will use when writting my programs
- This configuration turns off all optimizations and includes debuggin information
- Makes my program larger and slower but easier to debug
- Usually selected as the default configuration

The release configuration is designed to be used when releasing my program to the public
- Typically optimized for size and performance
- Doesn't include debugging information
- Also useful for testing the performance of my code

Custom build configurations can be made, but there is rarely a reason to do so

# Syntax Errors
Syntax errors occur when a statement is written in a way that violates C++ grammar rules (see Example 3.1.1)
- These errors are caught by the compiler so they can easily be found and fixed

# Semantic Errors
Semantic errors occur when a statement is written in a way that technically follows C++ grammar rules but violates other rules
- Some errors can be caught by the compiler (see Example 3.1.2)
- Most errors are only caught during runtime
  - Some can crash the program immediately (see Example 3.1.3)
  - Most will just produce the wrong value (see Example 3.1.4)

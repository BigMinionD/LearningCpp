# A General Approach to Debugging
Once a problem has been identified, debugging consists of six steps:
- Find the root cause of the problem
- Ensure I understand why the problem is occuring
- Determine how I will fix the problem
- Repair the issue causing the problem
- Retest the program to ensure the problem has been fixed
- Retest the program to ensure no new problems have occurred
- See Example 3.2.1 for debugging
